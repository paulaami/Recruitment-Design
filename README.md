## General Information

    Website was implemented based on graphic template from Figma. 

    Handling of drop down menu and linking depending on the current page has been added in JavaScript files.

    Below are suggestions for improving the website according to WCAG principles and a description of the changes made to achieve this goal.

## Technologies Used

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- SASS 1.34.1
- JavaScript ES6


## Setup
  Live demo: [https://paulaami.github.io/Recruitment-Design/](https://paulaami.github.io/Recruitment-Design/)

## Improvements

  The website is not completely compliant with WCAG standards for accessibility.

  What should be improved:

    1) Links in the navigation have too poor contrast with the gray color provided. 
    2) The 'see all' text in the button also has incorrect contrast.

  What has been improved:

    1) Some images provided in the graphic design had too much weight, 
        they were passed through the converter to reduce their weight.
    2) Added line height in text 1.5 (line height in Figma template was too narrow)
    3) Added text highlighting on hover actions

This page was also rendered using the React library.
